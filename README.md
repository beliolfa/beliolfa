I'm Javier MartÃ­nez.

First of all, I'm a person. Married to the best woman in the whole planet and father of two of the most beautiful (and annoying) children in the universe.

Then I'm Lead Developer at [64 Robots](https://www.64robots.com/). The most kickass software agency on the United States. We do cool products with Nuxt, Laravel and Tailwind.
